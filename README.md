# Hanabi

Hanabi is a command line, 3-player implementation of the cooperative card game [of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)). This program is written in Python and requires Python 3.6+ (f-strings are used for string formatting). Currently, the program requires the user to make moves for Players 2 and 3. In the future this game may be extended to include an AI for Players 2 and 3 so that the user does not play for these teammates and will be unable to see its own cards, which should be hidden.  

## Running the Game

To run, clone the repository, open a terminal in the project directory, and enter `python hanabi.py`.
